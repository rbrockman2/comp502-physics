The 24 raw data variables did not produce better results than the 8 derived variables. Ideally, we would want the SOM to perform as well or better on the raw parameters as on the derived parameters. There are several reasons why this might not be the case initially, and why more sophisticated analysis could fix the problem. Firstly, the physicists presumably already have a good intuition for what sorts of variables are the “defining” variables of a system. So by using their derived variables, we are leveraging their intuition. If we make the very reasonable assumption that their intuition is effective, then we reduce the amount of work the SOM must do in finding underlying patterns, because much of the work has already been done. 
A primary cause of this lack of effectiveness is that the derived variables include 3 angles and already normalizes momentum vectors regardless of direction. These angles were independent of the absolute direction of the resulting quark jets, whereas the 24 raw data variables depended on the absolute angular direction of the jets. For the purposes of the analysis from a physics perspective, an event where the detected jets are just a rotation of the jets of another event should be considered the same event. However, the neural networks examined are unable to perform this rotation automatically by themselves (which is not expected, either). In continuing this analysis we need to attempt to align the x, y, and z momenta of the jets in order to make sure similar events are classified together by the neural network. We believe that this will produce even better results as we cannot be sure the 8 derived variables take into account all of the data of the 24 raw data variables.
