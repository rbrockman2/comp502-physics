Statement of Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the discovery of the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider
 (LHC), all of the important predictions of the Standard Model of particle
 physics have been tested.
 The focus of particle physics has now shifted to the search for new particles
 associated with extensions of the Standard Model.
 One such search involves the search for a particular particle associated
 with an extension to the Standard Model known as supersymmetry (SUSY).
 In particular, physicists at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector group
 at the LHC are interested in verifying a SUSY model that predicts specific
 p-p collision events which generate the super-symmetric partner to the
 top quark known as the 
\emph on
stop
\emph default
 squark.
 Verification of these models requires an efficient classifier capable of
 separating signal 
\emph on
stop
\emph default
 squark events from background events.
 More efficient classifiers allow discoveries to be made with fewer events,
 less expensive beam time, and thus lower cost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our initial objectives are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use Neural Networks to build a classifier for distinguishing two types of
 collision events.
 One type of event indicates the presence of supersymmetric particles (specifica
lly, a 
\emph on
stop squark
\emph default
), and the other background type does not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Our goal is to make a classifier that is better and more efficient than
 models currently being developed and used.
 We will compare our results against two other methods of classification.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The CMS detector group at the LHC currently uses classifies the events using
 a series of cuts on a set of eight derived parameters (discussed below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Onkur Sen is attempting to improve upon this with a decision tree algorithm,
 also on the derived parameters.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The efficiency of the classifiers will be compared by measuring the discovery
 significance per unit beam luminosity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If these objectives can be achieved quickly and easily, we can proceed to
 accomplish larger goals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We would like to create a production version of the neural network algorithm.
 This would include parallelizing the code so that it can run efficiently
 on Bonner Lab and RCSG computing clusters at Rice.
 We want to create a working tool that CMS can use to evaluate real physics
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another further goal is to build an unsupervised clustering method to detect
 the occurrence of new types of events in simulated collisions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Technical Approach to Initial Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our classifier will be trained on simulated data generated by PYTHIA, a
 particle physics simulator which can be tuned to represent the appropriate
 SUSY model.
 If the SUSY theory under consideration is correct, a classifier which works
 on the simulated data will detect the 
\emph on
stop 
\emph default
squark on the real data from the CMS detector.
 The raw data has been provided by Onkur Sen, a senior physics major working
 with Professor Paul Padley at Bonner Lab.
 His senior thesis involves using boosted decision trees to solve the same
 problem, so we will have a readily available standard of comparison against
 which to judge our performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The raw simulated data consists of events which produce 6 particle clusters
 (called jets), each of which is defined by a 4-vector (relativistic momentum
 and energy).
 Thus each event fundamentally consists of 24 variables and a classification
 (signal or background).
 In addition, Python scripts provided by Onkur derive 8 scalar features,
 which Dutta, et al.
 have judged to be useful in separating out SUSY events from the background
 event

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will run the data through a supervised learning paradigm to teach a network
 to respond appropriately to the presence of the absence of the 
\emph on
stop
\emph default
 particle.
 In this we will use our standard, n-layer backpropagation algorithm.
 We will have as many input PE's as prominent features, and since we are
 working with a simple classifier, we will have simply 2 output PE's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contingent upon the time taken to complete the steps mentioned thus far,
 we may be able to further analyze this data using unsupervised learning
 methods.
 We may be able to find a way to classify these different events by looking
 at the way in which the 2-D competitive SOM became organized.
 This may help to characterize the separation between the two different
 types of events.
 We can also compare these methods to the derived parameters to see if the
 detected separating parameters coincide with the derived parameters.
 Alternatively, we could use the number of significant dimensions from a
 GHA based approach to indicate how complex the events are.
 overlap is seen between the may prove more useful in determining a “natural”
 dimensionality of the data.
 Ideally, we will derive different higher-level features from the data with
 our own methods.

 with parameters from the background event type.
